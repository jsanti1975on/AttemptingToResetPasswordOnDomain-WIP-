Title explains all, My mentor set me up a domain and im assigned to change the password

I researched and 2 common methods are PowerShell and Using Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)

I decided to try powershell method first

I typed the command "Import-Module ActiveDirectory" but however it was not loaded

I moved on and put Set-ADAccount -Identity "username" -ResetPassword "newpassword". This was blocked off as well so powershell is No-Go

From here it was most likely 2nd method so I manually went into my settings

After several attempts of changing up the password to the point that it was completely new I would often keep getting this error:

After that my final method was by Using Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) and just by trying to run it windows could not find it. You can see I typed it correctly too.
